# Neuromorphic Rhythmic Control of Quadruped Locomotion

This repository contains the simulation framework for a neuromorphic control system applied to quadrupedal locomotion. The design integrates rhythmic spiking neural oscillators with event-driven feedback for gait stability and disturbance rejection.  

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.  
2. Open MATLAB (R202x or later).  
3. Run the initialization script:  
   ```matlab
   cambridge_init.m
4. Run the Simulink model for the quadruped locomotion simulation:
   ```matlab
   cambridge.slx

**Option:** You can also run the half-center oscillator simulation separately:
   HCO.slx
